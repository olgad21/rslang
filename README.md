## RS Lang

RSLang is a group project for RSSchool (EPAM) for 3 people. This app helps Russian-speakers to learn English with playing games, exploring new words from a e-book, choosing different levels of vocabulary and games, and tracking progress on the statistics page (games are in progress).

I was responsible for sign-up, authentification and statictics functionality.
